# RAG-LLaMA3-PDF-Processor

# RAG-Based PDF Question-Answering System Using LLaMA 3 and LangChain

**Project Overview**

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) method for creating a question-answering system. It utilizes the LLaMA 3 language model in conjunction with LangChain and Ollama packages to process PDFs, convert them into text, create embeddings, and then store the output in a database.

# 1. **PDF to Text Conversion**

**Definition:** This module handles the conversion of uploaded PDF files into plain text format. It forms the basis for further processing like chunking and embedding.

# 2. **Text Chunking and Embedding**

**Definition:** The extracted text is divided into manageable chunks, and embeddings are generated using the LLaMA 3 model. This step ensures that the information is stored in a format that is easy to retrieve and query.

# 3. **Template-Based Prompting**

**Definition:** Templates are created to guide the model's response generation based on user prompts. This structured approach helps in retrieving relevant information from the text embeddings.

# 4. **Chain Creation**

**Definition:** A chain of operations is built to handle the end-to-end process of input query processing, information retrieval, and response generation using the LLaMA 3 model.

# 5. **Question-Answering and Output Storage**

**Definition:** The system answers user questions by retrieving relevant information from the embeddings and templates. The output is then stored in a database for future reference.

# 6. **Technologies and Tools**

**Definition:** This section lists the technologies and tools used in the project, including Python, LangChain, Ollama, LLaMA 3, and relevant libraries for PDF processing and database storage.

# 7. **Installation and Setup**

**Definition:** Instructions on how to set up the project locally, including environment setup, package installations, and running the system.

# 8. **Usage Guide**

**Definition:** A guide on how to use the system, including how to upload PDFs, enter prompts, and retrieve answers.

# 9. **Future Enhancements**

**Definition:** A roadmap for potential future improvements, such as adding support for more file types, improving the chunking algorithm, or integrating additional models.
